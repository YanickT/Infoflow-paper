# Relative entropy

This subpackage holds the scripts for calculating the
cutoff using [relative entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence).

The relative entropy is calculated between the input and the considered layers, where the activations are normalized
and interpreted as probability distributions.


## Note
The implementation differs from the differential entropy as the differential entropy is more stable and two versions
ahead by now - April 2024
